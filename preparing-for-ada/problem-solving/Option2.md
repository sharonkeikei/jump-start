### (Option 2) Make a Paper Snowflake
For this activity, you will write precise instructions to make a paper snowflake. You will need to find someone to carry out those instructions to test your algorithm's clarity. While they are following your instructions, you are only allowed to watch, they are not able to ask you questions.

When listing the steps in your procedure, you should assume the person following your instructions is as straightforward as a computer (they do not make assumptions or ask for clarity). Let the person know who is following the instructions to interpret them as literally as possible. If your algorithm does not work out as expected, modify your algorithm and test on a new person until you get the desired output.
